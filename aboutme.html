    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>My name is Jundi Prima and I have always been interested in learning and exploring new ideas. I completed my primary and secondary education at <span class="highlight">SMKN 1 Cibinong</span>, a vocational high school in West Java, Indonesia, where I studied <span class="highlight">automation control</span> and developed a passion for critical thinking and problem-solving.</p>
    <p>After completing high school, I pursued a degree in <span class="highlight">instrumentation control industries</span> at <span class="highlight">Politeknik Negeri Jakarta</span>, one of the leading polytechnic universities in Indonesia. During my studies, I developed a strong foundation in the principles and applications of instrumentation control industries, which helped me to better understand how to design and control various industrial processes.</p>
    <p>Currently, I am exploring the field of programming and its potential applications in solving real-world problems. I am excited to continue learning and growing in this field, and to use my skills and knowledge to make a positive impact on the world around me.</p>
